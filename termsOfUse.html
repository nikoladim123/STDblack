    <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:2.2vw;">THE STU <br>
      Terms of Condition </h2>
    <h3>THE STU:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps Clients book spaces and related services for photography, videography, music, dance, rehearsal, events, and more through the booking page on our website.</li>
      <li>Helps the owners of those spaces list their professional studio spaces through our “register a studio” page on our website.</li>
      <li>Showcases your work when you submit your content (music videos, photography, dance videos, etc.) to our website through our “featured page.”</li>
      <li>Posts news and events on creative Clients like photographers, videographers, musicians, dancers, etc., and events through our news page on our website.</li>
      <li>Promotes creative Clients like photographers, videographers, musicians, dancers, etc., and events through our social media platforms.</li>
      <li>Processes all payments through our website using PayPal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please read the terms and conditions described in our agreement below carefully, and prior to using our services, as it governs your use of our website.</p>
    <p><b>Importantly, this Agreement contains waivers of class actions and jury trials and an agreement to submit all claims and disputes to binding arbitration in Section 4 below. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, including those governing disputes in Section 4, you may not use our platform or services.</b></p>
    <p><b>Agreement</b></p>
    <p>This THE STU Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a contract between THE STU LLC (“THE STU” or “we”) and the person(s) that are registered with THE STU (“user” or “you”). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions, including our content
      policy, that apply to your use of the THE STU marketplace to book or list Spaces or other related services through our website or apps, and governs your Space for other users; and establishes the obligations owed between you and THE STU, and
      between you and other users.
      Throughout this Agreement, the term “Service” means the service allowing clients to book music, photography, videography, event, dance, rehearsal, and other studios, including event space rental and related services, through the booking page on
      our website, or offer your professional spaces and related services to others through our website or apps (the “Platform”). The term Service does not include any services provided by third parties.</p>
    <p>A "Client" is the party booking a studio or event space.</p>
    <p>A "Vendor" is the party listing a studio or event space.</p>
    <p>A “Space” is the physical space that is made available to a Client to use during specific times, and subject to specific Fees and any site-specific terms or limitations. A Vendor may “List” a Space by providing certain details about the Space
      including availability, pricing, and terms or limitations of use; this posting about a Space is called a “Listing.” A Vendor always determines their own rules and fees on their respective profiles on the Platform.</p>
    <p>A Client may “Book” a Space by accepting the times, fees, and any additional terms (such as fees for Additional Services) or limitations of the Listing. A “Booking” is (i) only the grant of a limited, temporary, revocable license to use a
      Space, and (ii) if applicable, a contract for Space Services, in the manner, for the time, and subject to all restrictions provided, subject to this Agreement, and as confirmed through the Platform. The scope of the use, including times,
      specific fees, and other additional terms or limitations, constitutes a “Booking Agreement” that incorporates the terms and conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies. A Booking does not provide you a lease but only allows you limited
      access to use the Space or other Vendor service only as permitted in the Agreement and, as applicable, the Booking Agreement.</p>
    <p>This Agreement is organized into 5 sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Section 1: General Terms</b> includes general terms describing your Account including creating an account, accepting or making payments, and describing how we communicate with you.</li>
      <li><b>Section 2: Platform and Service</b> describes how you may and may not use the Platform and Service, and also describes how we use any data.</li>
      <li><b>Section 3: THE STU Services</b> establishes the obligations of Vendors, including how to List a Space and what is expected of any Space Listed through the Service; and the obligations of Clients, including Booking a Space, expected
        behavior, responsibility for payment of Fees, and Booking other services.</li>
      <li><b>Section 4: Termination, Disputes, and Binding Arbitration</b> describes termination or suspension of this Agreement or your Account, and the process of resolving any disputes.
        <b>This section contains waivers of both class actions and jury trials, and an agreement to submit all claims and disputes to binding arbitration. Please read this section carefully before accepting this Agreement –you may not use the
          Platform or Services if you do not agree to this section.</b>
      </li>
      <li><b>Section 5: Additional Legal Terms</b> provides additional legal terms including our ability to update this Agreement, disclaimers and limitations on our liability, and a prohibition on users outside of the United States. It also includes
        other documents governing your use of the Services including our Community Guidelines, Fees, Privacy Policy, and Cancellation and Refund Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have questions about this Agreement, please contact us. Your use of the Platform or Services constitutes your ongoing acceptance of this Agreement, as amended.</p>
    <p><b>Section 1: General Terms</b></p>

    <p><b>1.1 Services</b></p>
    <p>THE STU provides you access to Services through the Platform. You may access the Platform through our website or apps. You may use the Service to List Spaces, Book Spaces as a Client, communicate with other users, and access your Account.</p>
    <p>You may also be permitted to Book Space Services (“Space Services”) through third-party service providers or through the Vendor, which may require you to agree to additional terms or conditions. These Space Services may include Audio
      Engineering, Production, or other Services that can take place in the Spaces. This is however not the main marketplace Service provided by THE STU.</p>
    <p>We are continuously improving the Platform or Service for all users and reserve the right to make changes at any time. Changes we make to the Platform or Service, including discontinuing certain features, affect all users and we try to
      minimize disruption to users. However, these changes may affect users differently. We are not responsible if any specific changes we make to the Platform or Service adversely affect how you use them.</p>

    <p><b>1.2 Your Account</b></p>
    <p>Before using the functionality of our Platform or Services, you must create an account with THE STU (“Account”) and provide us with information about yourself or your company. We may ask that you update your Account or provide additional or
      different information at any time. This includes requiring additional details about Spaces or payment information. Any employees, contractors, or third-parties opening a new or using an existing account (collectively, “Agents”) represent and
      warrant that they have authorization to act on behalf of a person or entity they claim to represent; and if such authorization is not provided by the person or entity, such Agents acknowledge personal liability for all obligations and
      liabilities arising from or related to use of the Account by such Agents.</p>
    <p>You will be required to provide an email address and password to keep your Account secure (“Credentials”), and agree to keep your Credentials private and secure. You are responsible for any actions taken on your Account using your Credentials
      whether or not authorized or taken by Agents to List or Book a Space or Space Services. You are solely responsible for the actions or communications of your Agents. We are not responsible for and disclaim all liability for use of your Account
      by your Agents.</p>
    <p>When creating or using your Account, you may be required to provide information about yourself or your Space. You will only provide Content to us that you own or have authorization to provide, and ensure that Content is accurate and complete.
      You must keep any Content current, including your contact or payment information. We reserve the right, but shall not be obligated, to use public and private data sources to validate the accuracy of any Content. This may include validating your
      identity or business information, or verifying information about Spaces. You will provide us any additional information to verify the accuracy or completeness of any Content that you provide and we may condition your use of the Platform or
      Service on our ability to verify the accuracy and completeness of this Content. If you do not provide required Content to us as and when we request it, we may suspend or terminate your Account. THE STU will not accept or post any pornographic
      Content.</p>
    <p>User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable
      laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members
      against third party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender
      registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).</p>
    <p>If you are not at least 18 years old, you may not open an Account, access the Platform, or use the Services. Users (including Agents) who use the Services or the Platform to List or Book Spaces, Space Services on behalf of individuals under 18
      years old, or provide access or use of Spaces by individuals under 18 years old, accept personal liability for all acts or omissions of such individuals.</p>
    <p>You may close your Account at any time by contacting us through the Platform. You are responsible for all activity associated with your Account made before it is closed including payment of Fees, Taxes, or other Payments; providing use of
      Spaces to Clients as previously Booked; or other liabilities caused by or resulting from use of the Platform or Service. You understand that we may retain Content and continue to display and use any public Content (including reviews of Vendors
      or Spaces) provided to us prior to closing your Account.</p>
    <p>At our sole option, we may suspend or terminate your Account.</p>

    <p><b>1.3 Compliance with Laws</b></p>
    <p>As used in this Agreement, “Laws” means all applicable federal, state, local, and other governmental laws, regulations, ordinances, codes, rules, court orders, and all recorded and unrecorded private contract, restrictions, covenants and other
      agreements . You will comply with all Laws applicable to your use of the Space, Services, Platform, Space Services, whether as a Vendor or Client. While we may provide information to help you understand certain obligations of using or listing
      Spaces, we are not authorized to provide and do not provide any legal advice. You are solely responsible for your compliance with Laws and may only use the Platform or Service in compliance with applicable Laws. If you are unsure how to comply
      with Laws, you should seek legal advice related to Listing or Booking a Space. THE STU is not liable for ensuring compliance with Laws. It is the responsibility of Vendors and each listing owner to ensure all Laws, especially local zoning
      ordinances, and tax compliance at all levels, are met. You must also legally report income generated from THE STU to your business and it is your responsibility to do so. If you are responsible for charging local taxes on services, you must
      also comply with these regulations.</p>

    <p><b>1.4 Fees and Taxes</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) THE STU Fees.</b> We charge a ten per cent (10%) service fee to the Vendor, and a six per cent (6%) service fee to the Client booking the Space. The 6% service fee to the Client is included in the Booking price at checkout. The 10%
      service fee to the Vendor is deducted during the payout. Vendors do not get paid out until the Booking/Session is complete.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Fees Overview.</b> You are responsible for payment of fees, expenses, and other amounts related to a Booking (“Fees”). Fees include amounts paid to THE STU, Vendors, and Space Services. THE STU receives Fees for providing use of the
      Service, and Vendors receive Fees for Bookings. The specific Fees charged are presented when you request, complete, and pay for a Booking. Please review the Vendor's individually listed cancellation policy on their Listing prior to submitting a
      Booking request. You should contact Vendors through the Platform before Booking if you don’t understand the Fees listed or their cancellation policy that will be applicable. Please contact us through the Platform at any time if you do not
      understand Fees or have questions regarding them.</p>
    <p>While we may facilitate the collection of Fees for Spaces and Space Services, once remitted to Vendors, we are not responsible for the return of Fees or Deposits to Clients, where applicable.</p>
    <p><b>(c) Overtime Fees</b> A Booking provides a limited use of a Space or Space Services as described in the Listing and Booking Agreement, if applicable. If you use a Space or Space Services beyond the Booking you will be responsible for
      payment of additional Fees (“Additional Fees”) at the Vendor's discretion. The Vendor is solely responsible for collecting additional payment for such overtime use of the Space. The Stu is not responsible for collecting this payment or any
      circumstances outside the original Booking Agreement.</p>
    <p><b>(d) Fines for Damages.</b> Clients are solely responsible for any damage done to the Space during a Booking. THE STU encourages Clients and Vendors to work through this with one another directly. Please reference Section 3.3 of this
      Agreement for required and supplemental insurance coverage. If you need to report any damage to your Space, Equipment, or other, please first contact any local authorities, if necessary, your insurance provider, and notify THE STU through our
      Platform.</p>
    <p><b>(e) Taxes and Fines.</b> You are solely responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, penalties, and other costs imposed by any taxing authority or government agency related to Listing or Booking Spaces or Space Services including any sales
      or occupancy tax, indirect taxes such as valued added tax (VAT) or goods and services tax (GST), usage or permitting fees, duties, and other taxes imposed by municipalities, states, or governments through regulation, ordinance, law, or judicial
      or regulatory interpretation (collectively “Taxes”). Except as required by Law, THE STU will not calculate, track or pay Taxes or submit Tax reporting on your behalf. You are responsible for all Taxes owed for Booking or Listing a Space, or
      providing or using Space Services including, without limitation, accurate calculation of Taxes due, timely remittance of Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and maintenance of any required records and accounts. If any taxing authority
      demands that we pay such Taxes on your behalf, you are immediately liable to us for such Taxes and will reimburse or pay THE STU for such Taxes upon demand. You are also responsible for any penalties arising from your failing to comply with
      this Agreement including those issued by regulatory or taxing authorities, law enforcement, fire code or safety agencies, or other third parties; or that may be issued by us for losses we or users incur that are based on your failing to comply
      with this Agreement or misuse of the Platform, Services, Space, or Space Services (collectively, “Fines”). You understand and agree that THE STU does not provide you with any advice or guidance of any kind or nature regarding Taxes and that you
      have been advice to consult with your tax advisor for any required advice or guidance regarding Taxes.</p>
    <p><b>(f) Payment.</b> You will timely and fully pay any Fees, Taxes, or other amounts you owe under this Agreement. Clients will not be permitted to use any Spaces until full payment is processed for the Space and any Space Services. If you owe
      amounts and we are unable to receive payment through the Platform for any reason, then we may require that you pay through other means (such as direct debit). We may set-off any amounts owed to us through collection of funds that would
      otherwise be payable to you through the Platform. You are responsible for any costs or expenses associated with our recovering Fees, Taxes, or Fines owed, including our attorneys’ fees or expenses.</p>

    <p><b>1.5 Receiving Payment</b></p>
    <p>Acceptance and payment of funds between users or THE STU on the Platform (“Payment Processing”) is provided by PayPal. Your use of Payment Processing is subject to the PayPal Connected Account Agreement that includes the PayPal Services
      Agreement as may be modified by PayPal from time to time (collectively, the “PayPal Agreement”). As a condition using Payment Processing, you must provide accurate and complete information about you and your business and you authorize us to
      share this information to PayPal. All bank and credit card information is sent directly to and stored with PayPal using their security protocols. THE STU does not store your payment information on its systems and shall not have any
      responsibility for the safety or security of that information. Your use of Payment Processing is conditioned upon your compliance with the PayPal Agreement, and if the PayPal Agreement is terminated by PayPal you may not be able to use the
      Platform, or have your Account suspended or terminated.</p>
    <p>We may change or add other payment processing services at any time upon notice to you, which may be subject to additional terms or conditions.</p>

    <p><b>1.6 Communication and Notices</b></p>
    <p>We may communicate with you and provide you information or notices regarding your Account or transactions through email or through messaging on the Platform. You will promptly respond to any communications you receive and understand that
      failure to do so may impact your ability to Book or List Spaces, or use the Platform or Services.</p>
    <p>We may send you notices to the email address or physical address included in your Account, through messaging on the Platform. You may send any notices to us. You agree that any email notice from us is considered accepted by you one day after
      such notice was sent and will have the same legal effect as if it were physically delivered to you.</p>
    <p>You agree to receive any communications from us and transact with us electronically. This acceptance of emails or other electronic messages constitutes your consent and your electronic signature has the same legal effect as physically signing
      a document. You may withdraw this consent to transact electronically at any point by providing written notice to us. However, given that electronic communication is integral to the Platform and the Services, following any such notice we may
      elect to close your Account.</p>
    <p>If you have problems communicating or receiving messages, please first please contact us</p>

    <p><b>1.7 Communication with Other Users</b> </p>
    <p>The Platform allows you to communicate with other users without disclosing sensitive personal contact information. It is your responsibility to use good judgment in the information you provide to other users. You may use the Platform only to
      List or Book Spaces or Space Services, communicate with us or other users, resolve disputes, or use other functionality we provide to you through the Platform. You may not use the Platform to send messages that are unwanted or unrelated to a
      Listing or Booking through the Platform, use the Platform to harass or attempt to market other services to users, or send spam.</p>
    <p>We strongly recommend that you should use the Platform to communicate with other users. If you use other means of communication you understand that you may be putting your personal contact information at risk of misuse. You also understand
      that any communications made outside of the Platform may impair your ability to recover all or some amounts owed to you in the event of a dispute between you and another user.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for, and disclaim all liability resulting from, any losses or harm to you resulting from sharing personal or sensitive information with other users, or communicating or engaging with users outside of the Platform.</p>
    <p>THE STU, at its sole option and without notice or any obligation to do so, may from time to time (i) remove communications among users which contain or share personal contact information, or (ii) suspend or terminate the accounts of users that
      share personal contact information.</p>

    <p><b>Section 3: THE STU Services</b></p>
    <p><b>3.1 Listing Spaces - This section applies to Vendors</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Listings.</b> When you List a Space, you must provide details about the Space including a description, the cost of a Booking, a list of equipment, current pictures, and other details about its potential uses and condition (collectively,
      “Description”). While it is important to communicate the benefits of your Space, the Description must be accurate and give potential Clients a reasonably good understanding of how they may use the Space for their Booking. Descriptions may not
      include any additional contractual obligations or alter Client's legal liabilities from those described in this Agreement.</p>
    <p>You must clearly describe the Space and the services that you are offering. Do not misrepresent pricing or dishonestly make claims by any means. We will take proactive action if it is reported or discovered that you are misrepresenting your
      Space or the services that you offer.</p>
    <p>Only list the Space that you are permitted to offer and for which you have the authority to do so. If you are subletting a space and are not permitted to then further offer it, do not offer it on THE STU without consent by the owner to do so.
      If it is discovered that you are offering a Space on THE STU that you do not have permission to offer, the listing will be immediately removed and your account is subject to removal from our site.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Transacting with Clients.</b> All Vendors must comply with this Agreement when Listing a Space, providing a Description, and in transacting with Clients. You are responsible for maintaining the Space and Space Services so that Clients
      may reasonably use them as provided in the Description and Booking. Spaces must be in good working order and provided to Clients in a safe, clean, and usable condition as described. </p>
    <p><b>(c) Conduct and Fees.</b> As a Vendor, you are solely responsible for ensuring that Space complies with all applicable Laws including any local ordinances related to the condition, licensure, or registration Spaces for use by Clients, and
      payment of Taxes. We may condition your continued use of the Platform and Services on your providing proof, to our reasonable satisfaction, of your compliance with Laws at any time.</p>

    <p><b>3.2 Booking Spaces and Space Services - This section applies to Clients</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Bookings.</b> As a Client, you should review the Description and availability to confirm they are appropriate for your Booking. The Platform allows you to confirm any details or ask the Vendor any specific questions about the Space or
      Space Services, or confirm details of a Booking, without sharing your personal contact information. Prior to Booking, you will need to provide payment information through the Platform. Booking Fees will be shown before you complete your
      Booking. You are responsible for all Fees and Taxes associated with the Booking. All Bookings are subject to the Cancellation Policy listed on each individual Space Listing.</p>
    <p>When you Book a Space, you are only provided a license to use the Space as described in the Booking and confirmed by the Vendor, subject to this Agreement and any Booking Agreement. A Booking does not provide you a lease or access or use of
      the Space beyond the specified time and Description.</p>
    <p>Booking must be done by individual Clients, but may be on behalf of an LLC or other business entity if the individual Client is the sole owner of the business entity.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Conduct and Fees.</b> You will comply with any Booking Agreements throughout the Booking and use the Space or Space Services only as permitted or agreed upon and consistent with the Description, and assure that any attendees do the
      same. During your Booking, you are responsible for (i) the behavior and acts of others in attendance that access the Space, (ii) ensuring that the use does not exceed any limitations identified in the Booking, (iii) complying with applicable
      Laws. You are responsible for, and accept all liability for, any damage done to the Space during your Booking by yourself or others in attendance whether intentional or not, for your failure to comply with applicable Laws, and for any Fines you
      incur. You agree the Space and all equipment will be in substantially the same condition as provided to you or as otherwise agreed in any Booking Agreement and to promptly notify Vendors of any damage done to the Space or Amenities.</p>

    <p><b>3.3 Required and Supplemental Insurance</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Required Insurance. </b> Every user will acquire and maintain all insurance as required by Law and suitable for you or your business. You are solely responsible for understanding and evaluating what insurance is appropriate to cover
      damage, loss, injury, legal liability, and other harm specific to you, your business, those attending the Booking, third parties, the Vendor, and deciding what coverage, limits, and providers are appropriate for you.</p>

    <p><b>3.4 Cancellations and Refunds</b></p>
    <p>All cancellations and any refunds that may be available to you are subject to our Fees and all cancellations are subject to the THE STU Cancellation Policy, in addition to any individual Vendor Cancellation Policy as identified on each
      individual Space's Listing. THE STU is not liable for any fees, expenses, or liability that is not in compliance with the Cancellation Policy for a Listing.</p>

    <p><b>Section 4: Termination, Disputes, and Binding Arbitration</b></p>
    <p><b>4.1 Term, Termination, and Survival</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Term and Termination By User.</b> You consent to this Agreement when you first access or use the Platform or Services, and your continued use of the Platform and Services constitutes your ongoing consent to this Agreement as amended
      from time to time. You may terminate this Agreement by closing your Account with us, however this will not immediately terminate any ongoing rights or obligations you or we may have. This includes any obligations to pay for Bookings, to honor
      any Bookings made before termination, or to pay Fees, Taxes or Fines due; or any liabilities that you incurred prior to termination.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Suspension or Termination by THE STU.</b> We may suspend your Account--including your ability to communicate with other users or receive payments, or complete a Booking--or terminate this Agreement and your Account at any time
      including, without limitation, (i) if we believe that use of your Account poses a risk to THE STU, you, other users, or third parties, (ii) actual or potential fraud by you or on your behalf, (iii) your failure to respond to communications from
      us or other users, or (iv) your failure to comply with this Agreement or applicable Law.</p>
    <p><b>(c) Survival.</b> The following provisions will also survive termination of this Agreement: Sections 1.3 (Compliance with Laws), 1.4 (Fees and Taxes), 1.6 (Communication and Notices), 1.7 (Communication with Other Users), 2.1 (Ownership,
      License, Restrictions), 2.2 (Content), 2.3 (Privacy and Data Usage), Section 3.1(Conduct and Fees) for Vendors, Section 3.2(b) (Conduct and Fees) for Clients, 3.3 (Required and Supplemental Insurance), 3.7 (Cancellations and Refunds), 4
      (Termination, Disputes, and Binding Arbitration), and Section 5 (Additional Legal Terms).</p>
    <p><b>4.2 Binding Arbitration</b></p>
    <p><b>This section describes how disputes or claims arising under this Agreement between you and THE STU or between you and another user (not resolved through the process set forth in Section 4.3) will be resolved. It includes waivers to both a
        jury trial and your ability to join other plaintiffs as part of a class action. Please read this section carefully before accepting this Agreement—you may not use the Platform or Services if you do not agree to this section.</b></p>
    <p><b>(a) Process for Arbitration.</b> Subject to the exclusions provided in Section 4.2(b) and the process provided in Section 4.3, all disputes, claims, and controversies arising under or related to this Agreement between you and THE STU or
      between you and another user (if not resolved pursuant to Section 4.3 below) will be resolved through binding arbitration as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(i) if the amount of the dispute, claim, or controversy is reasonably less than $25,000, resolution shall be administered online by FairClaims (www.fairclaims.com) or another online arbitration provider of our choosing in accordance with
        their applicable arbitration rules and procedures effective at the time a claim is made. You consent to receive electronic service of process at the email associated with your Account. Where you are delinquent in responding to such process,
        you will be responsible for any attorney, court, or other fees associated with the delinquency. The party filing the User Dispute will be responsible for payment of any costs associated with that filing, including costs borne by THE STU. As a
        part of the User Dispute, you may also seek to recover these costs if you prevail.</li>
      <li>(ii) if the amount of the dispute, claim, or controversy is reasonably $25,000 or more, resolution shall be before a single arbitrator and administered by JAMS. This includes but is not limited to any statutory or common law claims relating
        to breach, enforcement, or interpretation of this Agreement and any Booking Agreement. Any such arbitration will take place in the county where the Booked or Listed Space is located, unless you and THE STU mutually agree otherwise. The
        arbitrator will apply the substantive Laws of Massachusetts. All claims from $25,000 to $250,000 shall be subject to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern all such arbitrations
        under this Agreement. To initiate such an arbitration, a party will provide a written demand that states both the basis of the claim and the desired relief. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through
        personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in this Agreement affects the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once arbitration is initiated as provided in Subsections (i) or (ii) above, the parties will share the costs of the arbitration, facilities, and arbitration reporters (as necessary) equally except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator.
      Each party will be responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and legal costs. The arbitrator may award the prevailing party recovery of any of the costs of arbitration or legal fees as they see appropriate.</p>
    <p>The arbitrator may provide for any monetary or other remedies that are available under applicable Law but may not modify the terms of this Agreement or any Booking Agreement. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned decision addressing the
      specifics of the dispute. The decision is binding and not subject to appeal. The parties will act promptly to respect the decision of the arbitrator, including payment of any amounts owed or taking of any action required.</p>
    <p>Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><b>(b) Certain Claims Excluded.</b> Notwithstanding Section 4.2(a), the parties agree that any claims based on ownership or misuse of the other party’s intellectual property—including patents, copyrights, or trademarks—may be brought before
      the state or Federal courts in Massachusetts. Either party may also seek provisional remedies for injunctive relief under such claims from a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p><b>(c) Class Action and Jury Waiver. Each party agrees that any action or claim arising from or related to this Agreement or any Booking Agreement may only be brought on an individual basis and not part of a class action or consolidated
        arbitration, or join claims with other users or third parties. Further, each party expressly waives its right to a jury in arbitration and court, where permitted. You may opt-out of this class action and jury waiver described in Section
        4.2(c) by emailing us within 30 days of your first use of the Platform or Services. You must include your name, phone number, physical address, and email address in your opt-out notice. This is your only mechanism for opting out of this
        Section 4.2(c) and failure to do so as described constitutes your consent to this waiver. If you choose to opt out of this Section 4.2(c), please note that all other provisions in this Agreement will remain intact and in full force and
        effect.</b></p>
    <p><b>(d) Conflict of Rules.</b> If any provision of this Section 4.2 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the reviewing court or arbitrator, as applicable, will interpret or revise the provisions only as minimally necessary to comply with
      Law. All the other provisions will remain enforceable and intact as written.</p>

    <p><b>4.3 Disputes Between Users</b></p>
    <p><b>This section describes how disputes or claims arising under this Agreement between you and another user will be resolved. Please read this section carefully before accepting this Agreement—you may not use the Platform or Services if you do
        not agree to this section.</b></p>
    <p><b>User Dispute Resolution.</b> All disputes, disagreements, legal claims, or conflicts of any kind ("User Dispute") that occur between Vendors and Clients are handled solely between the Vendors and Clients and will not involve THE STU in any
      way. You take full responsibility for resolving your own User Dispute and agree to leave THE STU out of it.</p>

    <p><b>4.4 Confidentiality of Proceedings</b></p>
    <p>Any proceedings pursuant to this Section 4 and their results will be maintained as confidential by all parties. Except as may be required by Law, the parties and those persons participating in the proceedings on their behalf will not disclose
      and will maintain the confidentiality of all materials, testimony, and evidence provided during the proceeding as well as the results of such proceeding. The parties agree to enter into a separate confidentiality agreement or order, as
      appropriate, to maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.</p>

    <p><b>Section 5: Additional Legal Terms</b></p>
    <p><b>5.1 Right to Amend</b></p>
    <p>We may amend or modify this Agreement at any time by posting the modified Agreement on our website, sending you a copy via email, or otherwise communicating the amendment to you through the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform or
      Services after we amend or modify this Agreement constitutes your consent to the revised Agreement.</p>

    <p><b>5.2 Cancellations</b></p>
    <p>THE STU is not responsible or liable for nonperformance caused by communication failures or nonperformance of Vendors.</p>
    <p>Cancellations of Bookings, whether with or without cause, or caused by events outside of your reasonable control, are subject to individual Vendor Listing Cancellation and Refund Policy. Please review it carefully before Booking a Space or
      Space Services.</p>

    <p><b>5.3 No Assignment</b></p>
    <p>You may not assign this Agreement or any rights granted to you, including operation or management of your Account, without our prior written consent. Any attempt to do so without our prior consent will be void. We may assign this Agreement
      upon notice to you as part of a sale or transfer of part or all of our business. Any permitted transfer will inure to the benefit of and bind any successors in interest.</p>
